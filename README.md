This application present high-level recommendations for a well-designed Angular application architecture based on best practices NgRx Signal Store state management.

- Zoneless Signal-based Component Architecture.
- NgRx Signal Store Deep Dive.

## Implementation 

This application provides a comprehensive learning experience by incorporating advanced Angular techniques and best practices.

ðŸ”¹ **State Management with NgRx Signal Store**: Understand how to use NgRx Signal Store for modern, high-performance state management, leveraging Angularâ€™s reactivity model for a more streamlined approach.

ðŸ”¹ **Creating Zoneless, Signal-Based Components**: build highly efficient, zoneless components using Angular Signals, eliminating unnecessary change detection cycles and improving performance.

ðŸ”¹ **Preloading Configuration Files**: Learn how to dynamically load a configuration file before the app initializes, enabling flexible settings management without modifying the code.

ðŸ”¹ **Custom SVG Icon Integration**: Implement a system for registering and using custom SVG icons within the application to enhance UI design and maintain scalability.

ðŸ”¹ **Internationalization (i18n) with @ngx-translate/core**: Explore how to implement multilingual support efficiently using a third-party library, making the app accessible to users in different languages.

ðŸ”¹ **Infinite Scrolling for Enhanced User Experience**: Learn to integrate infinite scrolling in a listing view, allowing users to load more data seamlessly as they scroll, improving performance and usability.

ðŸ”¹ **Global Error Handling**: Implement a centralized error-handling mechanism to catch and manage errors globally, ensuring a robust and user-friendly web application.

ðŸ”¹ **Dynamic Page Titles with Angular Router**: Set page titles dynamically using Angular Router.

## UI Features

- **Apartment Search Page**: browse available apartments.
- **Detailed Apartment Overview**: view comprehensive details about each apartment.
- **Multilingual Support**: the app supports internationalization in three languages, ensuring accessibility for a diverse audience.
